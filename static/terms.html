  </h1>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">The purchase of ITM Token involves various significant risks, e.g. there is no assurance that the ITM Platform or the
      ITM Token will ever become or remain effective or economic. Therefore careful consideration of the risks listed below
      is required and, it may be advisable to consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Dissolution and Diminishment of the Value</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets, such as bitcoins, may be subject to extreme fluctuations in
      price over short periods of time on a regular basis. Such fluctuations are based on market forces and represent changes
      in the balance of supply and demand. It is possible that the value of ETH will drop significantly in the future which
      could then cause a negative impact on the ITM Token resulting in ITM Parties not having sufficient resources to continue
      to operate. In order to guard against this risk, ITM intends to convert proceeds from the sale of ITM Token periodically
      into fiat currencies.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Losing Access and Unauthorized Access</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">ITM Token will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the User. If the password
      or the wallet respectively were lost, Users may lose all ITM Tokens purchased.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">As indicated above, Users are advised to store their password and any Private Wallet safely in one or more backup locations.
      To guard against any improper access to the ITM Tokens, the User should:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select a highly secure Password for the ITM Token wallet;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never store the Password and the Wallet at the same
      location;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never respond to any requests regarding the purchase
      of ITM Token (in particular email requests purportedly coming from ITM Parties or similar looking domain).</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Theft</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Hackers or other organisations may attempt to steal the ETH revenue from the ITM Token Sale and, thereby, potentially
      compromise the ability of ITM Parties to continue to develop the ITM Platform. To account for this risk, ITM has implemented
      comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the ETHs obtained from the ITM Token Sale, however, ITM makes no representation
      or warranty that these measures will be adequate.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Regulatory Action</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Cryptocurrencies, as a new technology, have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe.
      There is a risk that cryptocurrencies (or some type of it) may be declared illegal or trading in cryptocurrencies may
      become regulated. In either case, this may adversely impact on the value of ITM Token. In addition, the ITM Platform
      could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiry or action, which may compromise the ability of ITM Parties to continue
      to develop the ITM Platform.</span>
  </p>

    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Insufficient Interest in ITM Token</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">It is possible that there will be limited public interest in the ITM Token in general. Such a lack of interest could
      impact the development of the ITM Platform. ITM Parties expressly refrain from making any statements on the likelihood
      of success of the ITM Platform and the ITM Token.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Unofficial ITM Networks</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">After completion of the ITM Token Sale, it is possible that alternative unofficial ITM networks will be established,
      which use the same (open source) source code and open source protocol underlying the ITM Platform. In such a case,
      the official ITM network would be in competition with such alternative, unofficial networks, which could potentially
      negatively impact the ITM Project.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk Associated with Decentralized Applications</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">ITM Parties is one of several organisations attempting to build a platform which would facilitate the creation and deployment
      of decentralised applications. It is possible that different technical paradigms than the ones used in the ITM Platform
      or the ITM Token will prove to be better.</span>

    <span class="c0">The User understands that while the ITM Parties will ensure all reasonable efforts to complete the ITM Platform are undertaken,
      it is possible that the full vision of the ITM Platform may never be released. There can be no certainty that this
      project will be capable of successful development over time. In addition, it is uncertain that this project will be

  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Security</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">The ITM Platform is based on open-source software, and there is a risk that the ITM Parties, or other third parties not
      directly affiliated with the ITM Parties, may inadvertently introduce weaknesses or &quot;bugs&quot; into the core
      infrastructural elements of the ITM Platform causing the system to lose any or some stored ITM Token in one or more
      Users accounts.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span>ITM has taken steps to maintain and secure the infrastructure of the ITM Platform and will continue to do so after the
      ITM Token Sale (e.g. by working with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to supervise
      the Platform) but can</span>
    <span class="c17">[AD3] </span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;make assurances that these will be adequate.</span>

  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c5 c3">Risk of Technological Advancements in Cryptography</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Any state of art may be overruled over time, even more so in IT-based areas (such as code cracking, technical advances
      or development of quantum computers). It is possible that the technology surrounding the ITM Platform and ITM Token
      will be rendered obsolete by new inventions and technologies, which would adversely affect the project. In addition,
      technological advances may pose a security risk, as it could potentially result in the theft or loss of ITM Token.
      To the extent possible, ITM Parties intend to update the protocol underlying the ITM Platform to account for any advances
      in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures. ITM Parties expressly refrain from making any statements
      on the future of cryptography or the success of any future security measures.</span>

  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c3 c5">Risk of Increased Demand</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">If demand for ITM Token were to rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ITM Token could be created,
      the entire ITM Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. Subsequently,
      this could reduce the general interest in the ITM Project and ITM Token.</span>

  </p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Cryptocurrencies are not official currencies and they are not issued by any nation state. Taxation of cryptocurrencies
      is in many jurisdictions uncertain. However, it is likely that most jurisdictions will require taxes to be paid in
      the normal manner. In addition, some reliefs and exemptions from taxation which may otherwise be available where such
      transaction, payments or holdings in conventional currencies may be unavailable as a result of the use of cryptocurrencies.
